# MyLibrary
Program that lets users interact with a database of books.

The idea behind this project was to create an application that would let the user store information about the books that
they own. It provides functionality for storing where they where bought books, price, date of purchase, etc. lets them track loans 
to friends, and view statistics on their library, like total number of books of a specific genre, or total spent at a given shop.
 The data is stored in a database,and the program was written with someone who doesn't know how to use a database like Microsoft Access 
 or MySQL, or just doesn't like to.

I wrote the first version of this in 2013. It used a Microsoft Access database.
The second version was started in December 2014. I started from scratch, and used an object-orientated design, and it still used the Access datbase
In June 2015 I changed it to use A MySQL database, and I made several changes to the database design.

There are several features that have not yet been implemented, and many that do not work properly yet.
